* improve rust compilation 
    - don't build game_net for debug and release, only one target
* refactor world generator
* wait on network events on main_loop
* update on server should be triggered by timer
* add books for players with player's knowledge 

* Generation
* Unique items (one of a kind)
    - Duplicable by some magic item
    - Requires X of Y to duplicate
    - Rare
* Duplicator for above
    - Rare

* inventory containers (backpack element x, that is equipped on y)
* multilayers
    - creating a new chunk (maybe with an unique item..?)
    - creating a link between worlds
    - generating existing links/entrances


- player at screen center, load more chunk on the screen
- npc's created by server
- moving for npc's
